# Code-Cracker-Game
This game was created using Javascript which is open to contribution, which ive published on github for easy accessibility. This is basically an apk that lets user's guess the secret number. Which has 3 input fields, the Result panel, submit button and also a game reset button (HTML).

#Javascript
Behind the scenes (engine) runs on JavaScript Arrays, used a couple of For Loops to iterate numbers into my Global variable, used JS push function as well as Math.floor and Math.random functions, made use of If Statements and lastly i made use of Functions wich i'm starting to get the hang of, hopefully. 

I'm yet to work on the responsiveness, im still working on the functionality for now.

#Thanks for reading.
